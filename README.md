**AbsRename**
By Ryan Epp

---
**Features:**
Batch rename files to comply with media services like Plex or Jellyfin. 

**Example:**
- Change starting directory in file (or navigate using the built-in file explorer) to folder containing files you want changed
- Pick an option and change perimeters how you see fit (see code for more details)
- Run script
- Navigate around folders, or just type 'run' to start renaming

**Requirements:**
- Python 3 enabled terminal

**Bugs/Needs Improvement:**
- The entire process is clunky, but the script is written and ready to be used with few changes

**Notes:**
Although this was originally meant to be used for changing large amounts of episode filenames, it's a good template for renaming files in numerical order.
